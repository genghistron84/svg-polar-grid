## SVG Polar Grid

This is an HTML/Javascript script for generating polar grid SVGs for use in designing English Paper Piecing (EPP) mandala patterns.

The script allows you to set:
- the width and height of the pattern in inches, 
- the number of concentric circles to generate, 
- the number of angled lines (divisions),
- whether to draw half or quarter inch concentric lines
